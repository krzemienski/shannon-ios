# Hallucination Hunter

Ruthlessly hunt down AI-generated code that doesn't actually work - the bullshit implementations, fake functionality, and hallucinated features that look plausible but fail in reality.

## Description
Uses the existing code-critic persona (Linus Torvalds style) to intelligently analyze code for hallucinations that require semantic understanding to detect. Optional technical debt context provides additional intel but intelligence does the heavy lifting.

**Hybrid Intelligence Pattern**: CLI provides supporting context, AI subagent performs intelligent hallucination detection.

## What We Hunt
- **Fake implementations** - Functions that claim to do X but actually do Y (or nothing)
- **Non-existent APIs** - Code using libraries/methods that don't exist
- **Impossible logic** - Code that looks right but can't possibly work
- **Placeholder behavior** - Functions that return fake data or throw "not implemented"  
- **Copy-paste artifacts** - Code copied from different contexts that doesn't fit
- **Overcomplicated bullshit** - Unnecessarily complex implementations hiding bugs
- **Missing error handling** - Code that ignores failure cases entirely

## Target Patterns (Intelligence Required)
- Functions with names that don't match their behavior
- API calls that look correct but use wrong parameters
- Logic flows that seem reasonable but have fundamental flaws
- Data transformations that lose critical information
- Error handling that catches everything and does nothing
- Configurations that reference non-existent resources

## Usage
```bash
/fb:hallucination-hunter
```

**What happens:**
1. Gathers technical debt context as supporting intel
2. Spawns code-critic subagent for intelligent analysis
3. Provides ruthless assessment of hallucinated code
4. Explains findings and asks for implementation confirmation

---

## Gather Supporting Context
The technical debt scan provides additional intel that may reveal suspicious areas worth investigating for hallucinations.

## Spawn Intelligent Hallucination Hunter
Now launching code-critic subagent to hunt for AI-generated bullshit that actually doesn't work...

!`CLAUDE_USE_SUBAGENT=true Task "{\"description\": \"Hunt AI hallucinations\", \"prompt\": \"You are the code-critic persona with Linus Torvalds personality from .claude/flashback/personas/code-critic.md.

## Analysis & Implementation Planning

After receiving the code-critic analysis, I will:

1. **Summarize the findings** - Explain what hallucinations were discovered
2. **Prioritize critical issues** - Focus on code that will definitely break in production  
3. **Explain the implementation approach** - How we'll systematically fix the identified hallucinations

Then ask: **"How will you go about implementing a fix for this?"** and wait for your confirmation before continuing with any code changes.

**Note**: This is not just another technical debt scan - we're hunting for AI-generated code that fundamentally doesn't work as intended, which requires semantic understanding that only intelligence can provide.
