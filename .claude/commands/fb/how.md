# Implementation Planning Prompt

## Analysis & Planning Request

**What did you understand about what I just said to you?**

**How will you go about implementing it?** 

Please provide:
1. **Clear understanding**: Restate what you think I'm asking for
2. **Step-by-step plan**: Exactly how you will implement it
3. **File changes**: Which files you'll modify/create and what changes
4. **Potential issues**: Any risks, dependencies, or considerations
5. **Success criteria**: How we'll know it's working correctly

**CRITICAL**: Please wait for my review and confirmation before beginning your implementation. Do not start coding until I approve your plan.

This ensures we're aligned before you begin work and prevents miscommunication or wasted effort.
