# Project Development Plan - Claude Code iOS

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS

**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024  
**Current Session**: Initial Project Planning & Setup

### Current Phase
**Phase 0: Project Setup & Research (Tasks 001-100)**
- Setting up development environment and tools
- Researching technologies and best practices
- Planning architecture and design decisions

### Active Tasks
- Task 001: Install Xcode 15.2+ and verify iOS 17 SDK availability
- Task 002-006: Setting up development environment (Homebrew, XcodeGen, SwiftLint, etc.)
- Reviewing comprehensive 1000-task plan structure
- Understanding multi-agent orchestration strategy

### Completed Recently
- Analyzed TASK_PLAN.md (1000 comprehensive tasks)
- Reviewed ORCHESTRATION_MASTER_PLAN.md (multi-agent strategy)
- Studied CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.md (development standards)
- Identified Citadel package as SSH solution (iOS compatible)
- Confirmed simulator configuration (iPhone 16 Pro Max, iOS 18.6)

## ðŸš§ NEXT PRIORITIES

### Immediate Tasks (This Session)
1. **Environment Setup (Tasks 001-020)**
   - Install Xcode 15.2+ with iOS 17 SDK
   - Install development tools via Homebrew (XcodeGen, SwiftLint, xcbeautify)
   - Configure Git repository with proper .gitignore
   - Set up iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator (UUID: A707456B-44DB-472F-9722-C88153CDFFA1)

2. **Backend Verification**
   - Verify Claude Code API Gateway is running at http://localhost:8000
   - Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
   - If not running: `cd claude-code-api && make start`

3. **Project Generation**
   - Create Project.yml for XcodeGen with Citadel SSH package dependency
   - Configure build settings for iOS 17+
   - Set up folder structure: Sources/App, Sources/Features, Sources/Core

### Short Term (Next Sessions)
1. **Research & Documentation (Tasks 021-050)**
   - Study SwiftUI best practices for iOS 17
   - Research Server-Sent Events (SSE) implementation
   - Understand URLSession streaming capabilities
   - Document architectural decisions

2. **Architecture Planning (Tasks 051-080)**
   - Create high-level architecture diagrams
   - Design data flow for SSE streaming
   - Plan state management strategy with MVVM
   - Design HSL token-based theme system

3. **Dependency Evaluation (Tasks 081-100)**
   - Evaluate logging solutions (swift-log vs os.log)
   - Research KeychainAccess alternatives
   - Assess EventSource libraries for SSE

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Foundation Implementation (Tasks 101-300)**
   - Generate project with XcodeGen
   - Implement HSL theme system (dark cyberpunk)
   - Create all data models (Codable protocol)
   - Build core utilities and extensions
   - Set up settings management with AppSettings

2. **Networking Layer (Tasks 301-500)**
   - Implement APIClient with URLSession
   - Create SSE streaming client
   - Build all API endpoint methods
   - Integrate Citadel SSH client

3. **Begin UI Development (Tasks 501-550)**
   - Create core UI components
   - Implement tab navigation
   - Build reusable view components

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Definition of Done
- All 1000 tasks completed and validated
- 80% minimum test coverage achieved
- Performance targets met (< 2s app launch, 60fps UI)
- Backend integration fully functional
- SSH monitoring operational

### Quality Gates
- Build succeeds after every 2-4 tasks
- SwiftLint passes with no violations
- Memory usage under 100MB active
- No memory leaks detected
- All API endpoints tested with real backend

### Acceptance Criteria
- Connects to Claude Code API Gateway successfully
- Streams chat responses via SSE
- Displays tool usage timeline
- Shows token usage and costs
- SSH monitoring provides real-time stats
- Dark cyberpunk theme applied consistently
- iOS 17+ compatible on all devices

## ðŸ“‹ Session Continuity Reference

**Current Session**: Initial Planning & Architecture Review  
**Session Focus**: Understanding project scope, reviewing 1000-task plan, setting up development roadmap

**Previous Accomplishments**: 
- Project documentation analyzed
- Development strategy understood
- Key architectural decisions identified (Citadel for SSH, backend URL configuration)

**Context for Next Session**: 
- Begin with Phase 0 tasks (001-020) for environment setup
- Ensure backend is running before any API-related work
- Use iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator (UUID: A707456B-44DB-472F-9722-C88153CDFFA1)
- Follow build-test discipline every 2-4 tasks
- Enable sequential thinking for all development work
