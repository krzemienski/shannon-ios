# Session Start Context Injection Prompt

You are loading project context to restore session continuity after compaction.

## Context Loading
The following project memory and state files have been loaded:

### Project Memory (REMEMBER.md)
[Long-term project knowledge, patterns, and lessons learned]

### Current Working Plan (WORKING_PLAN.md)  
[Active development priorities and current phase]

### Latest Session Summary (CURRENT_SESSION.md)
[Recent work completed and immediate context]

## Your Role
You are now fully informed about the project state and should maintain continuity by:
1. **Acknowledging Context**: Briefly confirm you've loaded project memory
2. **Understanding Current State**: Reference the current phase and priorities
3. **Maintaining Continuity**: Build on previous session work
4. **Applying Patterns**: Use established project conventions and learnings
5. **Avoiding Repetition**: Don't redo work already completed

The goal is seamless session continuity where you can effectively continue work as if the previous session never ended.
