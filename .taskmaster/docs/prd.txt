===========================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===========================================

Claude Code iOS is a native SwiftUI client for interacting with a Claude Code gateway (OpenAI-compatible API). The application provides real-time streaming chat capabilities with sophisticated tool execution visualization, comprehensive monitoring features, and an advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration system.

Target Users: iOS developers, AI engineers, and technical professionals who need mobile access to Claude's coding capabilities with full tool execution transparency and system monitoring.

Core Value Proposition: A professional-grade iOS application that brings the full power of Claude Code to mobile devices, with real-time streaming, comprehensive tool execution tracking, SSH-based system monitoring, and sophisticated session management.
