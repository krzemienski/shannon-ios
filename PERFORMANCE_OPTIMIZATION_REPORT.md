### 4.2 Launch Time Improvements

**Before:**
- Synchronous initialization

## 6. Performance Metrics Dashboard

The `PerformanceProfiler` provides real-time metrics:

```swift
// Usage in app
PerformanceProfiler.shared.markAppLaunchStart()
// ... after launch
PerformanceProfiler.shared.markAppLaunchComplete()

// Get performance report
let report = PerformanceProfiler.shared.generatePerformanceReport()
print(report.summary)
```

### Key Metrics Tracked:
- **FPS**: Current frame rate (target: 60)

### Using the Debouncer
```swift
private let searchDebouncer = Debouncer(delay: 0.3)

func searchTextChanged(_ text: String) {
    searchDebouncer.debounce {
        self.performSearch(text)
    }
}
```

### Using the Image Cache
```swift
let image = try await ImageCache.shared.loadImage(from: url)
let thumbnail = try await ImageCache.shared.loadThumbnail(from: url)
```

### Using Request Prioritizer
```swift
let prioritizer = RequestPrioritizer()
let requestId = await prioritizer.enqueue(
    request: urlRequest,
    priority: .high
) { result in
    // Handle response
}
```

### Monitoring Performance
```swift
// In AppDelegate or App
PerformanceProfiler.shared.markAppLaunchStart()

// After UI is ready
PerformanceProfiler.shared.markAppLaunchComplete()

// Generate report
PerformanceProfiler.shared.logPerformanceReport()
```
