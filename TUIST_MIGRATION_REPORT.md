# Shannon iOS - Tuist Migration Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The Shannon iOS project (Claude Code iOS client) is currently in the process of migrating from traditional Xcode project management to Tuist build system. While the Tuist infrastructure is in place and project generation works successfully, the build currently fails due to multiple compilation errors in the Swift code that need to be addressed.

## Current Tuist Setup Status ✅

### Successfully Configured Components

1. **Core Tuist Files**
   - ✅ `Tuist.swift` - Root configuration with project handle
   - ✅ `Project.swift` - Complete project definition with targets
   - ✅ `Tuist/ProjectDescriptionHelpers/Settings+Extensions.swift` - Build settings helpers

2. **Project Configuration**
   - ✅ Project name: ClaudeCodeSwift
   - ✅ Bundle ID: com.claudecode.ios
   - ✅ Deployment target: iOS 18.4
   - ✅ Supported destinations: iPhone, iPad

3. **Dependencies (via Swift Package Manager)**
   - ✅ Swinject (2.9.0) - Dependency injection
   - ✅ KeychainAccess (4.2.2) - Secure storage
   - ✅ swift-log (1.5.3) - Logging
   - ✅ Citadel (0.7.0) - SSH functionality

4. **Build Scripts**
   - ✅ SwiftLint integration
   - ✅ Build info logging
   - ✅ Build notifications

5. **Schemes**
   - ✅ ClaudeCodeSwift scheme configured
   - ✅ Debug and Release configurations

## Build Status ❌

### Tuist Commands Working
```bash
✅ tuist generate    # Successfully generates Xcode project
✅ tuist edit       # Opens manifest files for editing
✅ tuist graph      # Generates dependency graph
```

### Build Failing
```bash
❌ tuist build      # Fails with 50+ compilation errors
```

## Compilation Errors Analysis

### Error Categories (Total: ~50 errors)

1. **Missing Type Definitions (~30%)**
   - Theme.Typography missing members (caption, footnote)
   - Missing Terminal types (TerminalLine, TerminalCharacter, CursorPosition)
   - Missing ProjectError cases

2. **Actor Isolation Issues (~25%)**
   - Main actor-isolated properties accessed from non-isolated context
   - Synchronous calls to @MainActor methods
   - Missing await keywords for async operations

3. **Store/ViewModel Method Mismatches (~35%)**
   - ChatStore missing methods (setActiveConversation, renameConversation, etc.)
   - MonitorStore missing metrics properties
   - ProjectStore missing SSH-related methods
   - ToolStore missing favorites and history methods

4. **API Signature Mismatches (~10%)**
   - Incorrect parameter types (String vs Conversation/Project objects)
   - Extraneous or missing argument labels
   - Return type mismatches

### Most Critical Files to Fix

1. **Coordinators** (highest error concentration)
   - AppCoordinator.swift - Actor isolation issues
   - ChatCoordinator.swift - Store method mismatches
   - MonitorCoordinator.swift - Missing metrics methods
   - ProjectsCoordinator.swift - SSH configuration issues
   - ToolsCoordinator.swift - Access level and binding issues

2. **Components**
   - ListComponents.swift - Typography references
   - Terminal components - Missing type definitions

3. **Services**
   - SSH services appear to compile but coordinators can't access methods

## Recommended Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 hours)
1. Add missing Typography properties to Theme
2. Fix actor isolation with @MainActor annotations
3. Add stub implementations for missing Store methods

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (2-4 hours)
1. Align Store interfaces with Coordinator expectations
2. Fix parameter type mismatches
3. Add missing SSH configuration methods

### Phase 3: Terminal Module (Optional for MVP)
1. Either implement missing Terminal types
2. Or temporarily disable Terminal features for MVP

## Tuist-Specific Recommendations

### 1. Leverage Tuist Features
```swift
// In Project.swift, add conditional compilation for MVP
.target(
    name: "ClaudeCodeSwift",
    // ... existing config ...
    sources: [
        "Sources/**",
        .glob(pattern: "Sources/Terminal/**", condition: .when([.ios])) // Can disable if needed
    ],
    settings: .settings(
        base: [
            "SWIFT_ACTIVE_COMPILATION_CONDITIONS": "MVP_BUILD" // Use for conditional compilation
        ]
    )
)
```

### 2. Use Tuist for Parallel Development
```bash
# Generate focused workspace for specific features
tuist generate ClaudeCodeSwift --focus-targets ClaudeCodeSwift

# Use Tuist cache for faster builds
tuist cache warm
tuist build --use-cache
```

### 3. Add Build Phases for Validation
```swift
// In Project.swift
scripts: [
    .pre(
        script: """
        # Type checking before build
        swift build --target ClaudeCodeSwift --dry-run
        """,
        name: "Type Check"
    )
]
```

## Migration Completion Checklist

- [x] Install Tuist
- [x] Create Tuist.swift configuration
- [x] Create Project.swift with targets
- [x] Configure dependencies via SPM
- [x] Setup build settings and schemes
- [x] Generate Xcode project successfully
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with Tuist instructions
- [ ] Fix compilation errors
- [ ] Successfully build with `tuist build`
- [ ] Run on simulator
- [ ] Setup CI/CD with Tuist
- [ ] Document Tuist workflows for team

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Current working commands
tuist generate                    # Generate Xcode project
tuist edit                       # Edit manifests
tuist graph                      # Visualize dependencies

# Commands that will work after fixes
tuist build                      # Build the app
tuist build --configuration Debug --open  # Build and run
tuist test                       # Run tests
```

## Environment Details

- **Tuist Version**: Latest (check with `tuist version`)
- **Xcode Version**: Required for iOS 18.4 support
- **Swift Version**: 6.0 (configured in Settings)
- **Target iOS**: 18.4 (iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix compilation errors following the recommended strategy
2. **Short-term**: Get MVP building and running on simulator
3. **Medium-term**: Setup Tuist caching and CI/CD integration
4. **Long-term**: Modularize project using Tuist's multi-project support

## Conclusion

The Tuist migration infrastructure is successfully in place. The project generates correctly and all dependencies are resolved. The remaining work is fixing Swift compilation errors that exist in the source code, not related to Tuist configuration itself. Once these errors are resolved, the project will build and run using Tuist's modern build system, providing better reproducibility and maintainability than traditional Xcode project files.
