## How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies and setup
make bootstrap

# Build and run on simulator
make simulator

# Run all tests
make test

# Deploy to TestFlight
make beta
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Before committing
make pre-commit

# Check code quality
make lint
make analyze

# Generate documentation
make docs

# Run security audit
make security
```

### Release Workflow
```bash
# Create release build
make archive

# Deploy to TestFlight
make beta

# Submit to App Store
make appstore
```

### CI/CD
- Push to main/develop triggers CI pipeline
- Tag with v* triggers release pipeline
- All workflows configured in `.github/workflows/`

## Script Permissions
All scripts have been made executable with proper permissions.

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Automation**: Every aspect of iOS development is automated
2. **Modular Scripts**: Each script can run independently or as part of workflows
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging throughout
4. **Color-Coded Output**: Clear, readable terminal output
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Environment variables and parameters for customization
6. **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration
7. **Security First**: Built-in security scanning and audit capabilities
8. **Documentation**: Comprehensive help text and usage examples

## Next Steps

1. Configure GitHub secrets for CI/CD:
   - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`
   - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID`
   - `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`
   - `MATCH_PASSWORD`
   - `MATCH_GIT_URL`

2. Install recommended tools:
   ```bash
   brew install swiftlint swiftformat xcbeautify periphery sourcedocs
   gem install fastlane jazzy xcov
   ```

3. Set up code signing:
   - Configure development team in Xcode
   - Set up Fastlane match for team provisioning

4. Customize scripts for your workflow:
   - Update simulator UUIDs if needed
   - Configure team-specific settings
   - Add custom quality rules

## Maintenance

- Run `make update` regularly to keep dependencies current
